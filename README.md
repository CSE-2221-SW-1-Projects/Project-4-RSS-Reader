# Project-4-RSS-Reader

A program that asks the user for the URL of an RSS 2.0 feed and for the name of an output file including the .html extension, reads the RSS feed into an XMLTree object and then uses the information in the XMLTree object to generate in the output file a nicely formatted HTML page with table of links to all the news items in the original feed.
